# NPHSHomework

Created by Jeffrey Sun and Victoria Juan of Newbury Park High School as a final project for the Independent Studies Computer Science Project Honors class, 2016-2017.

The NPHSHomework app allows students to log in, view their class schedules, set up notification reminders for due dates, and view assignments from their classes all in one place, negating the need for students to find and navigate different teacher websites. 

## Information
This app is not fully functional, but further work has halted.

The NPHSHomework app is dependent on the back-end functionality of the NPHW database, API and website, [located here](https://github.com/Edylc/nphw).

To test, download or clone this project and run with Android Studio. 

Prerequisites:
* Internet Connection
* Android version 16+ (24+ preferred)
